### Initial Outreach

**Subject:** P29 Readiness Tool - Partnership Opportunity [Vendor Name]

Hi [Name],

Following our conversation at RISK Europe, I've built something I think could be valuable for [Vendor] and your clients.

It's a **Provision 29 Readiness Assessment tool**, backed by my 16 months delivering Sainsbury's Material Controls Programme. The platform includes:

• **Interactive assessment** (30 questions, 5 domains, 10 minutes)
• **Implementation roadmap** (24-month journey, 4 phases)
• **Template library** (15 ready-to-use templates)
• **Role-specific guidance** (Board, CFO, Risk, Audit, PMO)

**The differentiator:** It's co-brandable. Your logo, your colors, your messaging, your CTA.

For you, it's:
✓ **Lead generation tool** (qualify prospects via readiness score)
✓ **Client enablement** (accelerate implementations, reduce support burden)

## LINKEDIN ANNOUNCEMENT POST

🎯 **Excited to share the P29 Playbook Platform**

After 16 months delivering Sainsbury's Material Controls Programme, I've built an interactive platform to help FTSE 350 companies prepare for Provision 29 compliance.

**What it includes:**
📊 Readiness Assessment (30 questions, 5 domains)
🗺️ Implementation Roadmap (24-month journey)
📋 Template Library (15 ready-to-use templates)
👥 Role-Specific Guides (Board, CFO, Risk, Audit, PMO)

**Why it matters:**
P29 is the biggest change to UK audit requirements in years. Most companies are still figuring out their approach. This platform distills real implementation experience into practical, actionable guidance.

**For GRC technology vendors:**
The platform is fully co-brandable. Your logo, your colors, your messaging. Use it for lead generation, client enablement, or thought leadership.

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### Objection: "We already have our own P29 materials"
**Response:** "That's great - shows you're ahead of the curve. This platform doesn't replace your materials, it enhances them. Think of it as a client-facing front door to your expertise. You can integrate your own templates, link to your methodologies, and use it to demonstrate thought leadership. Plus, the assessment is a lead generation tool that sits on top of whatever materials you have."

### Objection: "Our clients won't use another tool"
**Response:** "Totally understand tool fatigue. Two points: First, this isn't a 'tool' they need to learn or log into daily - it's a resource they consume (like a website). No training, no onboarding. Second, the assessment is a one-time 10-minute activity that gives them immediate value (readiness score and priority actions). The rest of the platform is optional self-service content. Low friction, high value."

### Objection: "What if clients share it with competitors?"
**Response:** "That's actually a feature, not a bug. The platform is co-branded with your logo and messaging. If it gets shared, that's free marketing for you. Plus, the assessment creates a lead capture opportunity - even referred users become your leads. And remember, this is general P29 guidance, not your proprietary methodologies or client-specific work."

### Objection: "How much does it cost?"
**Response:** "Let's figure out the right model for you. I'm proposing we pilot with 5 of your clients over 8 weeks at no cost. If it works, we can discuss licensing (annual fee), revenue share (% of deals sourced), or service wrap (bundled with your implementations). What's most important to me is that it drives value for you - lead generation, client enablement, or differentiation. Which of those resonates most with your current priorities?"

### Objection: "We need to integrate with our CRM"
**Response:** "Absolutely. The assessment can be configured to submit lead data to any webhook or API endpoint. We can integrate with Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, or whatever CRM you use. During the pilot, we'll set that up so every assessment completion flows directly into your pipeline. Technical integration is straightforward - usually 1-2 hours of dev work."

### Objection: "What if Provision 29 requirements change?"
**Response:** "Great point - regulation evolves. I'm committed to keeping the platform current. The content (questions, templates, guidance) lives in JSON files, so updates are fast and don't require code changes. If FRC updates guidance or expectations shift based on early implementations, I'll update the content accordingly. You'd have input on those updates as a partner."
