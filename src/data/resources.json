From bottom-up control inventories that produce 150+ controls to vague materiality criteria that create scope ambiguity, learn the practical lessons that separate successful implementations from struggling ones.",

        "Mistake #1: Starting bottom-up instead of top-down from principal risks",
        "Mistake #2: Vague materiality criteria that lead to scope creep",
